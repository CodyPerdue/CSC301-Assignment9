		"bio":"This 1yo terrier mix has led quite the life; he was found running the Norwood lateral. Rugby is about 12-15lbs, long legged, and likely mixed with poodle. He is a bit of a fearful guy with new people and his dislikes include the vet, being told no, fast movements in his face, and being crated. Rugby enjoys running and playing outside, being near his people for snuggles, belly rubs, small dog friends that don't jump on him, and most importantly things that build his confidence without foregoing boundries. He loves affection, treats and being told he is a good boy. Rugby is almost housebroken, but does mark in a new place. As a newly neutered guy, this will likely subside easily but his adopters should be prepared for belly bands while he adjusts. Rugby\"s best home would be a laid back one without children and where he could be allowed to lounge in his own space when guests are coming over.",

True to his breed, he is also high energy, dedicated to his people, but has found some time between to lay on the couch with us for some belly rubs! Peanut butter appears to be confusing, but he is starting to like it!",

She loves to snuggle her humans and kiddos that are old enough to understand if she walks away she needs some alone time. She had no issues meeting the laid back resident dog in her foster home and even nose kissed her. She would do best as an only cat!",
